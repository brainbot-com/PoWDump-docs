Welcome to PoWDump, the DApp that lets you dump your PoW ETH!

The source code of the smart-contracts, subgraph, bots and website are all open source and available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/brainbot-com/PoWDump).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, the documentation assumes that you are a web3 developer and have some basic knowledge of:

- how smart-contracts work
- how to interact with a blockchain
- how a [graph node](https://thegraph.com/en/) works
- have some javascript/typescript knowledge
- if dealing with the website, some knowledge of React is required

If that is not the case a good way to start your web3 journey would be to go through the challenges
on [Speedrunethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/).

## Installation

First clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brainbot-com/PoWDump.git
```

The repository is set up with [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/). To install the
dependencies run:

```bash
yarn
```

You can look inside the packages folder and inspect the individual packages. Inside each package you can find a README.md
file explaining how the individual package works.
