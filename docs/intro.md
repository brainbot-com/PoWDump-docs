# Introduction

PoWDump is the prime venue for the Ethereum community to dump their PoW ETH, sunset the PoW chain faster, and save
the environment without having to go via a centralized exchange!

We are proponents of the Proof-of-Stake Ethereum, and we are happy
that [The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/)
was executed. Still, the reality is that
there is a Proof-of-Work fork. This leads to sort of an “airdrop” situation for ETH holders. Due to the fork, they've
received PoW ETH, which they probably don’t even want to hold.

PoWDump is a simple DApp that lets PoW ETH sellers create atomic cross-chain swaps which match them with buyers. This
makes it a secure, on-chain way to sell your PoW ETH, which doesn’t rely on centralized exchanges or trusted (wrapped)
bridges.

To find out how the swap works on a technical level, check out the [How the swap works](/getting-started/how-it-works)
page. If you want to dump immediately look at the [Seller's guide](/getting-started/seller).

If you are a developer interested in the project check out the [Development](/development/intro) section.
